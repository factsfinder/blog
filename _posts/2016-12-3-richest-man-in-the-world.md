Yes, I really want to be the richest man in the world. Why you ask? Well, it's not because I can spend my life happily on a private island having parties every day. It's because I want to achieve atleast half of my life goals, which includes eradicating hunger deaths once and for all. Don't laugh, because I'm not joking here. I'm dead serious. Well, if you are still laughing, the joke's on you.

That's all I can share for now. Thank you for reading so far now and will update this post once again when I did achieve my first goal.
Take care.
