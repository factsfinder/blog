I've been thinking about building my own Virtual Assistant for a long time. I've been developing my skills slowly over the last 2 years. 
Now, I'm ready to start working on it. I will work a minimum of 2 hours a day and will update my progress once every month.
You can find my code in this github repo => [Lucifer] (https://github.com/factsfinder/lucifer). If you're interested, you can also be a part of this. Clone the repo and start contributing.
