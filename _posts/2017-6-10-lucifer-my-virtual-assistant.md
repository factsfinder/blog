I've been thinking about building my own Virtual Assistant for a long time. I've been developing my skills slowly over the last 2 years. Now, I'm ready to start working on it. I will work a minimum of 2 hours a day and will update my progress once every month. I'll share the Github repo after three months. Thank you.
